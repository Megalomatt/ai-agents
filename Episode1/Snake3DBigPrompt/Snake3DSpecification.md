# 3D Snake Game Specification

## Project Goal
Create a high-quality 3D Snake game using Three.js. The game must be developed with clean, modular, and scalable code, adhering to modern JavaScript best practices and high coding standards. The final product should have a polished appearance, smooth animations, and intuitive gameplay, suitable for demonstration in a professional portfolio. The game should run smoothly at **60 frames per second (60fps)** on modern browsers.

## Requirements

### Core Game Features
- Implement classic Snake gameplay in a 3D environment.
- The snake moves on a three-dimensional grid or plane and grows longer each time it collects food.
- The game should end when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the play area.
- Ensure smooth snake movement, turning, and growth animations.

### Controls
- Implement responsive keyboard controls.
- Use arrow keys or WASD for directional input to control the snake.
- Optionally, support camera movement using the mouse or touch input, ensuring it does not interfere with gameplay.

### Visuals
- Create polished, modern graphics using Three.js.
- Include smooth 3D animations for the snake’s movement and body segments as they grow.
- Implement realistic lighting with ambient and directional lights, shadows, and high-quality materials to give the game a visually appealing look.
- Add a dynamic camera system that follows the snake while maintaining a clear view of the play area.
- Food should stand out, with glowing or animated effects to draw attention.
- The play area should be clearly defined, with visible boundaries and a stylized grid or platform.

### UI and UX
- Design a minimalist user interface that displays the current score in the top-left corner of the screen.
- Include Start, Pause, and Restart functionality.
- Implement a game over screen showing the final score and an option to restart the game.
- Ensure the user interface is clear, responsive, and easy to navigate.

## Technical Requirements

### Code Structure and Quality
- Write the game code in ES6+ JavaScript or TypeScript (preferred).
- Structure the code using ES Modules and follow the separation of concerns principle.
- Create distinct classes or modules for the following:
  - `GameEngine`: Manages the game loop, state, and core logic.
  - `Snake`: Handles movement, growth, and collision detection.
  - `Food`: Manages spawning, rendering, and interactions with the snake.
  - `Renderer` or `SceneManager`: Initializes and manages the Three.js scene, including the camera, lighting, and rendering loop.
  - `InputHandler`: Processes and responds to user input.
  - `UIManager`: Updates and manages UI elements like the score, game over screen, and buttons.
- Ensure all code is clean, readable, and well-documented.
- Use JSDoc comments or TypeScript type annotations to describe the function signatures and data structures.
- Apply consistent naming conventions and maintain modular, reusable code.

### Game Loop and Performance
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` to implement the game loop.
- Target **60fps** consistently during gameplay.
- Keep update and render loops efficient to maintain high frame rates.
- Optimize rendering and object updates to prevent performance issues.
- Properly dispose of Three.js geometries, materials, and objects when they are no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.

### Graphics
- Use the latest version of Three.js to build the game.
- Set up a visually appealing environment, such as a grid plane or skybox.
- Implement dynamic lighting using a combination of ambient, directional, and point lights as needed.
- Optionally, add basic post-processing effects such as bloom and tone mapping to enhance visual quality.

## Deliverables
- A single-page application that runs in modern web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.
- Provide an organized codebase with a clear entry point (`index.html` and `main.js` or equivalent).
- Include a `README.md` file with:
  - Setup instructions.
  - Gameplay controls.
  - Overview of the code structure.
- Optionally include:
  - Unit tests for key game logic (movement and collision detection).
  - Configuration files such as Prettier and ESLint to enforce consistent code quality standards.

## Optional Enhancements (If Time Permits)
- Add background music and sound effects for actions such as eating food and collisions.
- Implement difficulty progression where the snake’s speed increases as it grows.
- Include a leaderboard stored in `localStorage` or backed by a simple backend.
- Add customization options for the snake’s appearance, such as skins or colors.
- Add mobile and touch screen support for controls.

## Reference Example
The final game should feel like a modern reimagining of the classic Snake game in 3D, with smooth graphics, clean UI, and an overall polished, professional look.
